# GettingandCleaning-data
Course project

The file run_analysis.R contains the required code for generating the output. The 5 different parts of the questions are commented.
The final output data is saved in output_data1.txt file for the average value of variable for each activity.

The total no fo rows of combined dataset( training and test data) are very large and it takes long time to execute for 
Qn 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
So I have taken only 200 entries from the final dataset and generated the output file.
